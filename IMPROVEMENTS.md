# MCPS Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Model Context Protocol System (MCPS) based on the initial review.

## 1. Context Manager Enhancements

### Completed:
- Implemented full CRUD operations in the repository
- Added context versioning with proper schema and relationships
- Implemented caching mechanism using ETS for improved performance
- Added context size validation to prevent oversized contexts
- Created database migrations for contexts and context versions

### Future Work:
- Implement bulk operations for contexts
- Add more sophisticated caching strategies (e.g., LRU, distributed cache)
- Implement context compression for large contexts

## 2. Transformation Pipeline Enhancements

### Completed:
- Implemented the pipeline execution engine with proper error handling
- Added telemetry integration for monitoring pipeline performance
- Created a JSON validator transformer
- Enhanced the text normalizer transformer

### Future Work:
- Implement parallel processing for independent transformers
- Add more built-in transformers (e.g., content filtering, entity extraction)
- Create a DSL for defining pipelines declaratively

## 3. API Gateway / Web Interface Enhancements

### Completed:
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for contexts and pipelines
- Added authentication and authorization
- Integrated Swagger for API documentation
- Added CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Implemented health check endpoint

### Future Work:
- Implement GraphQL API alongside REST
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Add pagination for list endpoints

## 4. Telemetry System Enhancements

### Completed:
- Integrated telemetry throughout the system
- Added metrics for all key operations
- Implemented cache monitoring

### Future Work:
- Create Grafana dashboards for visualizing metrics
- Implement alerting for critical issues
- Add distributed tracing

## 5. Configuration Enhancements

### Completed:
- Added configuration for context size limits
- Added configuration for pipeline limits
- Added configuration for rate limiting
- Added Swagger configuration

### Future Work:
- Implement dynamic configuration reloading
- Add configuration validation
- Create a web interface for configuration management

## 6. Documentation Enhancements

### Completed:
- Created comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Added API documentation with Swagger
- Added inline documentation for key modules and functions

### Future Work:
- Create user guides and tutorials
- Add architecture diagrams
- Create developer documentation

## 7. Security Enhancements

### Completed:
- Implemented authentication with Bearer tokens and API keys
- Added authorization checks for context operations

### Future Work:
- Implement role-based access control
- Add audit logging
- Implement encryption for sensitive data

## 8. Performance Enhancements

### Completed:
- Added caching for contexts
- Optimized database queries with proper indexes
- Added telemetry for performance monitoring

### Future Work:
- Implement connection pooling
- Add database query optimization
- Implement horizontal scaling
